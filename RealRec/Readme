Here is the place where you can find the data for the RealRec test set in the paper.
There are two directory, 3b53 and 3b54, which means this test set are recorded in two real rooms.
In each directory, four sub-directories are included: AWPE, NN_based_RRS, Unprocessed, WF_based_RRS;
Unprocessed: the unprocessed original recordings and the wav files are zipped.
AWPE: Processed wav files based on the plain AWPE algorithm described in the paper.
WF_based_RRS: Processed wav files based on the AWPE+WF-RRS algorithm described in the paper.
NN_based_RRS: Processed wav files based on the AWPE+NN-RRS algorithm described in the paper.
